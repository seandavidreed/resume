To the Hiring Manager,

Three years ago while exploring career paths, I decided I would try learning to code. At the time, I'd been teaching music lessons for a few years, and though I have a knack for teaching, I wanted other options for the future. I dipped my toes in the water by enrolling in Harvard EdX's renowned CS50x course. By the time I got to the unit on C programming in Week 2, I was hooked. I wondered how I hadn't discovered this programming business sooner. I learned everything I could about C, enrolling in another course solely dedicated to learning the essentials of its syntax, idioms, conventions, and standard library. I bought a book called Bare Metal C, which walked me through C programming for STM32 Nucleo boards using the HAL library. Recently, I fortuitously came across a cheap copy of K&R at a local used bookstore and added it to my collection. 

Since my initial discovery, I've learned a great deal of other important toolsets, frameworks, and languages. However, I keep coming back to C and C++ and the low-level side of programming in which they're generally used. Recently, I began learning GNU assembly (I run Linux on my main machine, so GAS seemed a natural choice). I thoroughly enjoy low-level programming because I feel I can truly connect with what my code is doing, more than when working with the abstractions of scripting and high-level languages. In addition to my Computer Science degree program, I continue to indulge my curiosity by taking separate courses tailored to my interests. For instance, I'm working through a course on developing a multithreaded kernel from scratch. As I explore the industry, I find that the work in embedded systems is the kind of work I want to do, and the aerospace/defense side interests me in particular.

MagniX's vision for a future of electrically powered future is exciting. There's been a great deal of focus on EVs, and rightly so, but it's fascinating to see MagniX bring the revolution to aircraft. I'm interested in being a part of this movement as an Embedded Software Engineer Intern. There's plenty still to learn, and I'm very motivated to learn it. I'd love an opportunity to get to work with MagniX and further enhance my skills. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon! 

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
