To Elise Drennen,

Three years ago, I began considering a career change. I'd been teaching music for a few years, and though I found a knack for it, I didn't want to do it long-term. I decided I would learn to code. I dipped my toes in the water by enrolling in Harvard EdX's renowned CS50x course. By the time I got to the unit on C programming in Week 2, I was hooked. I wondered how I hadn't discovered this programming business sooner. 

After completing CS50X, I learned everything I could about C, enrolling in another course solely dedicated to learning the essentials of its syntax, idioms, conventions, and standard library. I bought a book called Bare Metal C, which walked me through C programming for STM32 microcontrollers using a hardware abstraction library. That led to exploring FPGAs, hardware design languages, and digital circuits with the popular online resource nandland.com. Finally, my latest side project involves learning to write an operating system kernel. I find all these topics absolutely fascinating. 

To put a capstone on my self-study, I enrolled in a CS degree program at Western Governors University, where I've enjoyed courses such as Discrete Math, Networks and Security, and Computer Architecture. Throughout this learning journey, I've found that my interest in computer technology includes not only software, but extends into the hardware and circuitry of computers and embedded systems as well.
 
There are a couple reasons why working at Tacoma Power interests me. First, The Engineering Intern opportunities at Tacoma Power are a natural extension of my interests and emerging skill set. I'm especially interested in job descriptions like that of _Generation Automation Engineering_. Tasks involving PLC Ladder logic, virtual machines, and circuit diagrams align with the experience I've been building both as a CS undergrad and as a self-taught programmer and tinkerer. Nevertheless, I'm open to whatever role is found to be the best fit, and I'm eager to get started. Last, Tacoma has been my home for much of my life. I'm excited by the prospect of being involved with such important work for one of my favorite cities.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon! 

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
