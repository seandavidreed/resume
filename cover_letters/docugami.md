Dear Hiring Manager,

I found a job posting for your Software Engineering Internship on thefreshdev.com, and after browsing your website, I believe that I would be a great fit for this role.
First, I'm eager to continue working on projects related to natural language processing and computer vision. Late last year, I took a class from HarvardX called CS50 - Intro to AI with Python, where I learned more about convolutional neural networks, Bayesian networks, Markov models, word2vec, and much more. Moreover, I've completed much of fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders course, which strengthened my skills in Python, pytorch, Jupyter Notebooks, and building and training models. I continue to study concepts like these in my BS in Computer Science degree program and on my own for my personal projects, one of which included training a computer vision model on a dataset of guitar sounds converted to spectrograms. The idea was to get the model to recognize guitar legato techniques and use this information to help generate accurate sheet music from sound files.

Second, I'm obsessed with organizing things and keeping information in order. Over the years, I've meticulously organized all the digital files I've accumulated in my life and digitized all my paper records, from whole journals to car repair receipts. I like having all my important documents in an easy-to-access space. Even better, I'd love to be able to correlate and make inferences on the data trapped inside those documents with the use of generative AI. If such insight is useful to me on a personal level, then it's indispensible on a commercial level. Browsing your website, it's clear that you see a profound need that many businesses have for such insight. They are constantly growing their quantity of small data, and I'm excited by your vision to help them make sense of it.

With a completed undergraduate degree in Business and a Computer Science degree in progress, I connect and resonate with the implementation and the aim of your vision. It's fascinating to see Generative AI deployed in a way that solves important problems. Your description of generative AI on your website is apt, referring to its commonly publicized use for "writing a customer service response letter in the style of William Faulkner" and "drawing pictures of a cat in the style of Salvador Dali." Contrary to this trend, your use case satisfies a real need, applying proprietary generative AI to help businesses organize and extract meaningful information from their ever-growing mountain of small data. I hope to join Docugami as a Software Engineering Intern, and assist in helping businesses not only manage their small data, but harness it to enhance their operations. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
