Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a programmer and Computer Science student seeking to make a career change from Music Instruction to Software Engineering. Three years ago, I caught the bug for programming, and after a lot of self-studying and building my own projects, I decided to return to school; I'm on schedule to graduate at the end of 2025.

I'm eager to take part in work that is both important and meaningful, so naturally, the job listing for Software Engineer Intern at AST stood out to me. Early on, I developed a strong interest in low-level programming with C and C++. I worked through a book called Bare Metal C, which introduced me to the world of STM32 microcontrollers. My interest in Embedded Systems was kindled. From there I tinkered with Raspberry Pi, Texas Instruments MSP430, and most recently, FPGAs. My experience is limited with some of these technologies, but I'm intensely interested in this realm and eager to propel my learning forward with an internship.

My experience is broader that than too. I've compiled a portfolio of side projects, including a small web application built with Django, Python, and Postgres for a coffee shop that is currently in production, and a CLI app built with C and sqlite to keep track of my students in my job as a music instructor. For the final example, I built a CLI app called Hasse Diagram Generator written in Rust, which takes in a partially-ordered set and models it with a Hasse Diagram. In designing this project, I translated the principles of Hasse diagrams and partially-ordered sets directly from my Discrete Math textbook into Rust code. I found the process of wrangling the abstract concepts in a math book and transforming them into code both challenging and rewarding.

Finally, I'm interested in work that relates to healthcare. Looking into aseptic processing, it seems like a perfect domain to hone my software engineering skills while engaging in work that provides a great benefit to society. Moreover, I also enjoy taking a break from the computer screen and working with my hands. It looks like an internship at AST would provide such an opportunity with the chance to perform machine testing, experimentation, and debugging.

I have much to learn and I’m highly motivated to do it. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level as a Software Engineer Intern at AST. Thank you for your time!

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
