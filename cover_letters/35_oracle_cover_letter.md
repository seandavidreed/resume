Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a programmer and Computer Science student seeking to make a career change from Music Instruction to Software Engineering. Three years ago, I caught the bug for programming, and after plenty of self-studying and building my own projects, I decided to return to school; I'm on schedule to graduate at the end of 2025.

I have three years of experience with C/C++, Python, and relational databases such as Postgres and sqlite. I acquired this experience by building a portfolio of side projects. The most significant is a small web application I built with Django, Python, and Postgres for a coffee shop; it is currently in production. The next significant project is a CLI app I wrote with C and sqlite to keep track of my students in my job as a music instructor. 

For the final example, I built a CLI app called Hasse Diagram Generator written in Rust, which takes in a partially-ordered set and models it with a Hasse Diagram. In designing this project, I translated the principles of Hasse diagrams and partially-ordered sets directly from my Discrete Math textbook into Rust code. I found the process of wrangling the abstract concepts in a math book and transforming them into code both challenging and rewarding.

My degree program takes up a fair bit of my free time, but I still allocate time for side projects. For my latest project, I wrote a simplified version of the RSA Encryption Algorithm in Python and documented the process on my website, www.seandavidreed.me.

I have more to learn and I’m highly motivated to do it. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level as an Associate Production Software Engineer at Oracle. Thank you for your time!

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
