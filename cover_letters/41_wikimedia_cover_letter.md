To Alisa Nguyen,

Everyone I know has benefitted from the existence of resources like Wikipedia. It's an especially important resource in a time when the internet is increasingly _enshittified_, borrowing the term from Cory Doctorow, by massive companies bent on maximizing engagement and minimizing actual value to humans. It makes the Wikimedia Foundation's mission to continue democratizing knowledge all the more urgent, and it's a mission I want to join. When I saw the Software Engineering Internship opportunity, I knew I wanted to apply.

I'm a Music Educator who went back to school to pursue a Computer Science degree, and I'll graduate by December 2025. Three years ago, I began learning the ropes of software development and quickly realized I wanted to make it a career. In addition to curricular projects, I've developed a personal portfolio consisting of projects written with languages like C, C++, Python, Rust, and with the web technology triad, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've built Command Line Interfaces like my Student Log program, written with C and Sqlite3, which I use to keep track of my music students' progress. I also built a web application with Django, Python, and Postgres that keeps track of inventory for a local coffee shop, and it's currently in production.

As a lifelong learner, I'm driven by curiosity, a trait that led me to explore software development. I'm highly motivated and always eager to learn. My interests in software often tend toward backend development, low-level languages, and working with the internals of a system. For instance, hacking with the Linux kernel has been one of my focuses lately. Among the roles listed in the internship opportunity, Site Reliability Engineering and Cloud Services stand out. However, I'm open to and interested in a variety of roles.

Further, I'm a team player: I've spent the last five years working one-on-one with music students of all different temperaments, skills levels, and ambitions. I'm focused on and committed to having positive, productive interactions.

I'm eager to hone my skills and get involved doing important work, the work being done at the Wikimedia Foundation. Thank you for considering me for this internship. I greatly appreciate your time, and I look forward to hearing back!

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
