Dear Hiring Team,

Your job posting on LinkedIn immediately caught my attention. A startup company providing software to an underserved industry is just the sort of place I want to work. Everyone needs to wash their cars - unless perhaps you drive an off-road vehicle and want the proof you went mudding over the weekend. For the rest of us, it's nice to have a consistent means to get things squeaky clean. As more and more car washes transition to the subscription model, the need is plain for effective software platforms and tools. I'm excited to see a startup tackling this need, and I dig the name too - Rinsed.

While I was growing up, my dad owned a self-serve car wash. Every Saturday morning, I went to the lot to tidy things up and help fix broken hardware. More than once a coin box had been bashed in and cashed in. While we were able to get things running reasonably smoothly, everything from the security system to the payment system was clunky and outdated. I can clearly envision how our car wash would have benefitted greatly from the tools and resources offered by Rinsed.

Though I come from a different background, working as a Music Instructor, I began programming and building things three years ago after taking Harvard EdX's online CS50 course. I caught the bug for programming and from there I went on to take several more courses and build a variety of projects. A few examples include a student assignment log (C/sqlite) I built for my work as a Music Instructor and an inventory management web app (Python/Django), which is currently used in production by a local coffee shop. 

By taking courses and building things, I've become proficient in C/C++, Python, Rust, Postgres, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and more; check out my website, www.seandavidreed.me, to see some of my projects. Additionally, I enrolled in a Bachelors in Computer Science program at WGU. After all my self-study, I wanted to fill in gaps in my understanding and tie all I had learned together. It's important to note that while my degree provides me deeper insight into all things computer science, it does not replace the experience and skills I gained from getting my hands dirty in the years leading up to it.

I think I would fit in well at Rinsed. I'm eager to get a chance to learn more and take my skills to the next level as a Software Engineer. Thanks for reading and for your consideration!

Sincerely,  
Sean Reed
