#### 2024-11-12 | Figma | Software Engineer Intern
I'm a big fan of products that facilitate collaboration, especially if they do it in a novel and engaging way. I especially like the FigJam tool; I've used various tools over the years, and nothing is quite like it, enabling collaboration in real-time designing process maps, aesthetically pleasing schedules, and just generally enhancing team communication with elegant visuals. I want to join Figma so I can support the further development of these tools.

#### 2024-12-02 | NetAcquire Corporation | Linux Software Developer
I'm a Computer Science student and programmer with a keen interest in Linux. I use Ubuntu and Gentoo on my daily machines, and I'm currently learning Linux kernel development through The Linux Foundation. I'm also taking a course on building a kernel from scratch. I love working with C/C++, being close to hardware, and I'm actively looking for a chance to work with Linux as a career. Thanks!
