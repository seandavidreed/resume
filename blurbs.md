I'm a big fan of products that facilitate collaboration, especially if they do it in a novel and engaging way. I especially like the FigJam tool; I've used various tools over the years, and nothing is quite like it, enabling collaboration in real-time designing process maps, aesthetically pleasing schedules, and just generally enhancing team communication with elegant visuals. I want to join Figma so I can support the further development of these tools.
